Features
========

mitoviz is a simple python package to plot human mitochondrial variants on a graphical
representation of the human mitochondrial genome. It currently supports plotting variants
stored in a VCF file.

Variants are shown according to their heteroplasmic fraction (HF), plotting variants with
HF = 1.0 on the outer border of the mitochondrial circle, those with HF = 0.0 on the inner
border and all the others according to their actual HF value.

If the HF information is not available, variants will all be shown in the middle of the
mitochondrial circle.

Usage
=====

mitoviz can be used both from the command line and as a python module.

Command Line
------------

Given a VCF file with human mitochondrial variants (``sample.vcf``), plotting them is fairly
simple::

    $ mitoviz sample.vcf

An image named ``mitoviz.png`` will be created in the current directory.

If you want to provide a specific filename where the plot will be saved, just add the ``--output``
option with the desired path::

    $ mitoviz sample.vcf --output my_mt_plot.png

If the provided VCF file contains more than one sample, a separate plot will be created for each
of them; if you want to plot only a specific sample, use the ``--sample`` option::

    $ mitoviz multisample.vcf --sample SRR1777294

Python Module
-------------

Import mitoviz and use its ``plot_vcf`` function to use it in your own script::

    from mitoviz import plot_vcf

    my_plot = plot_vcf("sample.vcf")

In this case, no plot will be shown until a call to ``plt.show()`` is made. It is possible to
save the resulting plot using the ``save`` option and to provide a specific file where the plot will be
saved using the ``output`` option::

    from mitoviz import plot_vcf

    plot_vcf("sample.vcf", save=True, output="my_mt_plot.png")

If the provided VCF file contains more than one sample, a separate plot will be created for each
of them; if you want to plot only a specific sample, use the ``sample`` option::

    from mitoviz import plot_vcf

    plot_vcf("multisample.vcf", save=True, sample="SRR1777294")

Please refer to the Usage_ section of the documentation for further information.

Installation
============

**PLEASE NOTE: HmtNote only supports Python >= 3.6!**

The preferred installation method for mitoviz is using ``pip``::

    $ pip install mitoviz

Please refer to the Installation_ section of the documentation for further information.
