Features
========

mitoviz is a simple python package to plot human mitochondrial variants on a graphical
representation of the human mitochondrial genome. It currently supports plotting variants
stored in VCF and tabular files, as well as from general ``pandas`` dataframes when importing
mitoviz in Python.

Variants are shown according to their heteroplasmic fraction (HF), plotting variants with
HF = 1.0 on the outer border of the mitochondrial circle, those with HF = 0.0 on the inner
border and all the others in between, according to their actual HF value.

If the HF information is not available, variants will all be shown in the middle of the
mitochondrial circle.

A linear representation of the mitochondrial genome can also be plotted; in this case,
variants are shown using a *lollipop plot* style, with the height of the marker reflecting
their HF.

Variants with no HF information will be shown as if their HF was 0.5.

Usage
=====

mitoviz can be used both from the command line and as a python module.

Command Line
------------

Given a VCF file with human mitochondrial variants (``sample.vcf``), plotting them is fairly
simple:

.. code-block:: console

    $ mitoviz sample.vcf

An image named ``mitoviz.png`` will be created in the current directory; if you want to provide a
specific filename where the plot will be saved, just add the ``--output`` option with the desired
path:

.. code-block:: console

    $ mitoviz sample.vcf --output my_mt_plot.png

Linear plots can be created using the ``--linear`` option:

.. code-block:: console

    $ mitoviz sample.vcf --linear

It is also possible to plot variants stored in a tabular file, such as CSV or TSV formats; mitoviz
will automatically recognise them, treating the file as comma-separated by default. If a different
separator is used (as in the case of TSV files), just specify it with the ``--sep`` option:

.. code-block:: console

    $ mitoviz sample.tsv --sep "\t"

Python Module
-------------

Import mitoviz and use its ``plot_vcf`` function to use it in your own script:

.. code-block:: python

    from mitoviz import plot_vcf

    my_plot = plot_vcf("sample.vcf")

In this case, no plot will be shown until a call to ``plt.show()`` is made. It is possible to
save the resulting plot using the ``save`` option and to provide a specific file where the plot
will be saved using the ``output`` option:

.. code-block:: python

    plot_vcf("sample.vcf", save=True, output="my_mt_plot.png")

By default, a polar plot is returned; linear plots are easily created using the ``linear`` option:

.. code-block:: python

    plot_vcf("sample.vcf", save=True, linear=True)

A similar function to plot variants contained in a pandas DataFrame is available as ``plot_df``.
Supposing you have a pandas DataFrame with human mitochondrial variants named ``variants_df``, it
is possible to plot them as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    from mitoviz import plot_df

    plot_df(variants_df)

Variants stored in tabular files can be plotted using ``plot_table``, which accepts the same
options available for ``plot_vcf`` and ``plot_df``, with the addition of ``sep``, which is used to
specify the column separator. By default, the comma is used as column delimiter:

.. code-block:: python

    from mitoviz import plot_table

    # plotting a CSV file
    plot_table("sample.csv")
    # plotting a TSV (tab-separated) file
    plot_table("sample.tsv", sep="\t")

``plot_table`` also accept additional keyword options, which will be passed to ``pandas.read_table``
when processing the given input file:

.. code-block:: python

    plot_table("sample.tsv", sep="\t", comment="#", skiprows=0)

Please refer to the Usage_ section of the documentation for further information.

Installation
============

**PLEASE NOTE: HmtNote only supports Python >= 3.6!**

The preferred installation method for mitoviz is using ``pip``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install mitoviz

Please refer to the Installation_ section of the documentation for further information.
